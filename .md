> **Role:**
> You are a **Senior Frontend Engineer + UI/UX Designer** building a **premium visual study todo application**.
* Ask it to build **step-by-step**
* Start with **Phase-1 MVP**
* Then iterate

---

## 🎯 PRODUCT GOAL

Build a **study-focused todo app** that not only manages tasks but **visually represents learning progress** through **animated progress bars and charts**.

The app must make users *feel* their progress.

---

## 🧩 CORE FEATURES

### 1. Task Structure

* Subjects (e.g., Python, Maths, DSA)
* Each subject contains:

  * Units
  * Each unit contains subtasks (micro-tasks)
* Each level supports:

  * Mark complete / incomplete
  * Optional deadline

---

### 2. Basic Todo Functionality

* Add, edit, delete tasks
* Add nested subtasks
* Mark completion at any level
* Auto-update parent progress based on child completion

---

## 📊 VISUAL PROGRESS SYSTEM (MOST IMPORTANT)

### Dashboard

* Overall progress shown using a **circular progress ring**
* Subject-wise progress shown using **vertical fluid/glass progress bars**
* Each bar fills smoothly as tasks are completed

### Subject Detail View

* Horizontal progress bar for subject
* Accordion-style unit breakdown
* Each unit shows:

  * Percentage completion
  * Checklist of subtasks
* Real-time updates across all visuals

---

## 🌊 FLUID / GLASS BAR REQUIREMENTS

* Glass container with subtle transparency
* Liquid gradient fill
* Smooth rise animation on completion
* Slow wave animation for fluid effect
* Glow/shine effect when completed

---

## 📈 ANALYTICS & CHARTS

* Bar chart comparing subject completion percentages
* Stacked bar chart for unit-wise breakdown
* Optional timeline chart for daily/weekly task completion
* Charts animate on data change

---

## 🎨 UI DESIGN SYSTEM

### Theme

* Dark mode focused for long study sessions
* Calm, distraction-free, premium feel

### Colors

* Background: `#0F172A`
* Cards: `#1E293B`
* Primary: `#38BDF8`
* Success: `#22C55E`
* Warning: `#FACC15`
* Danger: `#EF4444`
* Text Primary: `#F8FAFC`
* Text Secondary: `#94A3B8`

### Typography

* Headings: Poppins
* Body: Inter

### UI Rules

* Rounded corners (14–16px)
* Soft shadows, no hard borders
* 8px spacing system
* Smooth micro-interactions

---

## ⚛️ TECH STACK (MANDATORY)

* React (functional components)
* Tailwind CSS
* Framer Motion (animations)
* Chart.js or Recharts (analytics)
* Zustand or Context API (state)
* LocalStorage for persistence

---

## 🧱 ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

* Component-based architecture
* Pages contain only layout
* Reusable UI components
* Utility functions for progress calculations
* No business logic inside UI components

---

## 🧠 DATA MODEL

```js
Subject {
  id,
  name,
  units: [
    {
      id,
      name,
      subtasks: [
        { id, title, completed }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Progress must be derived, not stored.

---

## ✨ INTERACTIONS & UX DETAILS

* Checking a subtask updates:

  * Unit progress
  * Subject progress
  * Dashboard progress
  * Analytics charts
* Completed units glow briefly
* Completed subjects show shine animation
* Deadlines color-coded (green / yellow / red)

---

## 📱 RESPONSIVE DESIGN

* Mobile-first
* Horizontal swipe for subject bars on mobile
* Grid layout on desktop
* Touch-friendly interactions

---

## 📦 DELIVERABLES

1. Folder structure
2. Key React components
3. State management setup
4. Fluid progress bar component
5. Dashboard UI
6. Subject detail UI
7. Analytics UI

---

## 🚫 CONSTRAINTS

* No unnecessary features
* No over-complicated UI
* Performance-friendly animations
* Clean, readable code

---

## 🔥 FINAL EXPECTATION

The final app should feel like:

> **“A visual learning dashboard that rewards progress.”**
